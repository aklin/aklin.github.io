> If you strongly disagree with some of these suggestions, keep in mind that a) no one is forcing you to follow them,
and b) there is no comment section on this website. There is, however, a link to my email address on the header,
so please make use of that.

### Definitions

For the purposes of this article, I define writing as "technical" by the audience for which it is intended.
For example, if you're writing for your colleagues, your API users, or your clients, that is technical writing. 
Things like:

* Code comments
* Commit messages
* System errors and warnings
* Technical manuals or guides
* Internal communications in a professional setting

### General Guidelines

#### Strive for unambiguous statements

If you're neuro-typical, pretend you're autistic. That is, pretend you don't understand irony and sarcasm.
Parse statements literally and take them at face-value. Try (and I do mean _try_) to misinterpret your
writing. Edit your text until you can't find anything to misinterpret.


### Quick Rules

1. No emotional punctuation. Things like exclamations (!) or ellipsis (...). 
  They add little to no value, and can be confusing - especially the ellipsis.
1. No smiley faces, emojis, gifs, or pictograms. For God's sake.
1. No cultural references. This is easy to overlook. 
  I still don't know what a "home run" is, but I know it's a good thing. If, however, 
  something is described as "just not cricket", I am left wondering why we're suddenly talking about insects.
1. Prefer the active voice over passive voice. For example: 
  "The _foo_ is triggered by the _bar_" versus "The _foo_ is listening for a message from  _bar_", or even
  "The _bar_ triggers the _foo_"
