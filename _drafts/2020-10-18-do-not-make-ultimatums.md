An ultimatum is a status challenge disguised as a decision tree. These are the conditions
necessary to issue one:

1. You want to affect change
1. Someone other than you is able to make that change _or you'd do it yourself_
1. That other person is equal or higher status than you _or you would just order them to do it_
1. They do not want the change _or you wouldn't have to issue an ultimatum_
1. You're willing to sour your relationship with that person to get what you want
1. The consequence you propose is dangerous or harmful to you _or it would be a threat, not an ultimatum_

At this point you say to that person, _Do this or else_. In that sentence "this" is the change you 
want to affect, and "else" are the consequences you will suffer on that person if they
refuse.

# Do not make ultimatums

Put forth your best argument instead. Say, _You should do X because_ there's a compelling argument
to do so. The argument must be compelling to both parties, otherwise the other party will not agree to it.
This means you must explain to that other person how doing _X_ will help them, and why it is worth
the effort _for them_.


Let's issue someone an ultimatum.

If they accept you get what you want, right? Yes. And that person is always reminded how you were
able to make them do something they didn't want. As a result, maybe they won't like you as much.

That becomes a problem if you plan on working with them for a long time. They might be thinking
along the same lines, so they might use their higher status to make sure you don't get to work with
them for a long time. In other words, you invite retribution.

What happens if they don't accept? Then you must go through with the consequence. If you don't, 
you show that your threats have no bite in them, and that you're nothing but hot air.

# Do not accept ultimatums

If you are issued one, it means the person who issued it to you doesn't know how to negotiate, or doesn't
want to. That's not someone you want to be working with for any length of time.
